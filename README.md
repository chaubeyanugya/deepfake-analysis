# DEEPFAKE ANALYSIS 

# Introduction
Deepfakes use artificial intelligence to generate highly realistic fake videos, raising concerns about misinformation and digital security. This project presents a deepfake detection system that leverages deep learning models to analyze video frames and detect manipulated content. By integrating both spatial and temporal analysis techniques, the system provides a robust solution for identifying deepfakes and mitigating their impact.

# Models Used
The deepfake detection system employs two primary deep learning models:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These are used to analyze spatial features in individual video frames, detecting pixel-level anomalies that may indicate manipulation.
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTMs: These models analyze the sequence of frames over time to identify unnatural transitions and inconsistencies, enhancing detection accuracy for video-based deepfakes.

# Results
The system was trained and tested using benchmark datasets like FaceForensics++ and the Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset. Key results include:

1. Accuracy: 81% in classifying real and fake videos.
2. F1-Score: 0.90, indicating strong performance in detecting deepfakes.
3. Effective detection of frame-level anomalies using CNNs.
4. Improved sequence analysis with RNNs/LSTMs for better deepfake identification.
5. Real-time video analysis with a user-friendly interface.
